CLI - Command Line Interface

Process of making a commit:
2 Stage process -
	Stage -

	Commit -

git init  (Initialize git repository)

ls -a - show hidden files in directory

git status – What's going on right now

git add goatee.txt    or git add -m “Add this” goatee

VIM – I = Insert, esc, :wq (write and quit)

git log    (shows logs that happen up until where you are)

git diff   ( shows the difference)

Do both stages at once:

git commit -am “complimented his stache”

Every commit has a unique hash. (git log) – commit af3908uoijasdfjopij etc..

git show hashnumber -

	git show HEAD – Shows the last thing that was committed

echo “add” > mustache.txt   ----   > change all of the text, >> will append
